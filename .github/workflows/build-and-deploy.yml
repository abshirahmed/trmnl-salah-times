# Build and Deploy Workflow
#
# This workflow handles the continuous integration and deployment process for the TRMNL Salah Times project.
# It follows a trunk-based development approach where:
# - All branch pushes are tested and built to provide early feedback
# - All PRs to main are validated before merging
# - Only changes to the main branch are deployed to production
