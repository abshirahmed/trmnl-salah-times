Implementation: Write tests (unit, integration) alongside or before implementation (TDD/BDD). Focus tests on behavior/requirements, not implementation details. Aim for high test coverage of critical paths and logic.
Organization: Keep test files close to the code they test (e.g., *.test.ts or __tests__ directory). Use descriptive names for test suites and cases.
Completeness: Test edge cases, error conditions, and variations in input.
Isolation: Mock external dependencies (APIs, databases) appropriately for unit tests. Maintain separate and clean test data.
Documentation: Document complex test setups or expectations.
