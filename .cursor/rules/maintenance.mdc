Code Maintenance: Regularly remove dead or unused code. Refactor incrementally to improve structure and reduce technical debt. Keep external dependencies up-to-date. Monitor code quality metrics.
System Maintenance: Document operational procedures (deployment, updates, monitoring, backups, recovery). Plan for system updates and patches. Monitor system health and performance.
