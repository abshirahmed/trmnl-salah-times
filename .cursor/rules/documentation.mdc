Code Docs: Use comments (like JSDoc) to explain the "why" behind complex logic, algorithms, or workarounds, not just the "what". Keep documentation synchronized with code changes. Document architectural decisions.
READMEs: Maintain comprehensive README files at the project and module levels.
API Docs: Document all public APIs clearly. Specify parameters (types, required/optional), return values (including shape and types), and potential error conditions. Include usage examples. Keep API documentation current.
