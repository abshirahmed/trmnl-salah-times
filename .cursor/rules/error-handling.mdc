Error Management: Follow established error handling patterns. Validate inputs early. Use custom error types or hierarchies where beneficial. Provide user-friendly error messages at boundaries.
Logging: Use the project's standard logging utility. Log errors with sufficient context (e.g., request ID, user ID, operation). Use appropriate severity levels (error, warn, info, debug).
Security: Do not log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, PII) unless properly masked or encrypted.
Audit Trails: Ensure important operations have clear audit trails in logs.
