# Introduction to TRMNL Salah Times

## What is TRMNL Salah Times?

TRMNL Salah Times is a plugin for the TRMNL platform that displays accurate Islamic prayer times directly in your terminal. It provides a convenient way to keep track of daily prayer times without leaving your development environment.

## Key Features

- **Accurate Prayer Times**: Uses reliable calculation methods to provide precise prayer times for your location
- **Next Prayer Indicator**: Clearly shows which prayer is coming up next and how much time remains
- **Customizable Settings**: Choose your preferred calculation method and time format
- **Hijri Date Display**: Shows the current Islamic (Hijri) date
- **Minimal Interface**: Clean, distraction-free design that fits perfectly in your terminal

## Why Use TRMNL Salah Times?

As developers and tech professionals, we spend a significant amount of time in the terminal. TRMNL Salah Times helps you stay mindful of prayer times throughout your workday without disrupting your workflow or requiring you to check external applications.

## How It Works

TRMNL Salah Times uses the [Aladhan Prayer Times API](https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api) to fetch accurate prayer times based on your location and preferred calculation method. The plugin then displays this information in a clean, easy-to-read format directly in your terminal through the TRMNL platform.
